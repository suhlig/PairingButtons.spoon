    "doc" : "Runs Hammerspoon code on pressing a physical button\n\nIn a pair programming session, this Spoon switches between each pair's\nsettings on the press of a button. Two buttons are connected to a Teensy\n(or Arduino) which sends a MIDI SysEx message via USB when a button was\npresded. This Spoon applies whatever settings are associated with the button\nthat was pressed, e.g. switching the keyboard layout.\n\nInstallation:\n1.
